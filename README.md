# ðŸ˜¸ Task Kat ðŸ˜¸

## What is Task Kat?

Task Kat is a minimalist todo list to help keep track of all the tasks that we have going on in our lives. Design artefacts have been made in Figma and translated into a functioning UI using Svelte. 

## Objective

The primary objective for this project is to gain a deeper understanding of composing UIs with SvelteKit by creating a simple todo list app where users can add, edit, and delete their weekly tasks. Version one of this task list app will be focused on UI and functionality, meaning that the data used in the list will be localized to my machine. 

In the future Iâ€™d like to extend the functionality and learn how to handle data from an API once the core features and UI are all working.
